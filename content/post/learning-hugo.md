A million year ago I used to blog all the time.
<!--more-->
I was posting at least once a day for a while there.
Then my backups - which I had - wouldn't restore.
Then github crashed and all that was lost.

Now I'm hosted on github and playing with Hugo to turn static text into blog entries.

I'm still figuring out my workflow and I'm worried that I really don't have a mobile solution.

I'm considering a dropbox watching type thingy.
I really want to be able to post images, text and include tags all from the phone in super easy fashion.
And I'm cheap...
