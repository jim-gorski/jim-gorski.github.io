So I was really struggling with the Hugo theme concept
<!--more-->
they all looked amazing and the principle is pretty straightforward, just plop your markdown into a folder and let Hugo mangle it into static HTML for you.
This should be easy...
Every theme I tried was either insanely basic or so complex that Hugo would throw an error and cause much concern.

Then I found this theme
https://github.com/kakawait/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme

by this person
Thibaud Leprêtre

and I was saved.

Just wanted to recognize!

Thank you Thibaud Leprêtre
